    /* All CrocSwap swaps occur along a locally stable constant-product AMM curve.
     * For large moves across tick boundaries, the state of this curve might change
     * as range-bound liquidity is kicked in or out of the currently active curve.
     * But for small moves within tick boundaries (or between tick boundaries with
     * no liquidity bumps), the curve behaves like a classic constant-product AMM.
     *
     * CrocSwap tracks two types of liquidity. 1) Ambient liquidity that is non-
     * range bound and remains active at all prices from zero to infinity, until 
     * removed by the staking user. 2) Concentrated liquidity that is tied to an 
     * arbitrary lower<->upper tick range and is kicked out of the curve when the
     * price moves out of range.
     *
     * In the CrocSwap model all collected fees are directly incorporated as additional
     * liquidity into the curve itself. (See CurveAssimilate.sol for more on the 
     * mechanics.) All accumulated fees are added as ambient-type liquidity, even those
     * fees that belong to the pro-rata share of the active concentrated liquidity.
     * This is because on an aggregate level, we can't break down the pro-rata share
     * of concentrated rewards to the potentially infinite concentrated range
     * possibilities.
     *
     * Because of this concentrated liquidity can be flatly represented as 1:1 with
     * contributed liquidity. Ambient liquidity, in contrast, deflates over time as
     * it accumulates rewards. Therefore it's represented in terms of seed amount,
     * i.e. the equivalent of 1 unit of ambient liquidity contributed at the inception
     * of the pool. As fees accumulate the conversion rate from seed to liquidity 
     * continues to increase. 
     *
     * Finally concentrated liquidity rewards are represented in terms of accumulated
     * ambient seeds. This automatically takes care of the compounding of ambient 
     * rewards compounded on top of concentrated rewards. */
