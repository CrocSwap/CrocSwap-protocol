/* @title CrocSwap Pool
 * @notice The top level object represenitng a liquidity pool. A unique pool can exist
 *         for each possible combination of token pairs and fee tiers. The pool is 
 *         responsible for supporting individually staked concentrated and ambient 
 *         liquidity postions, aggregating those positions into a curve that behaves
 *         locally like a constant product AMM, bumping liquidity as concentrated 
 *         positions move in and out of range, and paying everyone's pro-rata shares
 *         of the mined liquidity rewards. */
